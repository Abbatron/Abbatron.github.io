        <p>
          The Arts that a student can choose from in the IB curriculum are
          Visual Arts, Drama, Music, Design, and Food Tech. These are all very
          different themes, but the way in which they are taught is essentially
          the same, with the same types of assessment and grading, with the aim
          being the production of some kind of product in all of the
          aforementioned subjects. Of course, the products in themselves vary
          widely, but the essential process the IB encourages students to follow
          remains similar enough that all the criteria for these subjects can be
          explained as one set of criteria, rather than 5. For the subjects that
          differ, I will provide that criterion as well.
        </p>
        <h3>MYP</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion A (<em>Design and Food Tech</em>)</strong>
            - Inquiring and analysing. This criterion is all about understanding
            the problem presented to the student. Students will be expected to
            select the target audience for their product, develop a detailed
            design brief for their product, and identify the problem and
            potential solutions. To do this, they are expected to do thorough
            research, including comparing existing products and solutions to the
            problem to get ideas and information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion A (<em>Arts</em>)</strong> - Knowing and
            understanding. This criterion, requires the student to have thorough
            knowledge of the art form they are studying at the time. The student
            must be able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the art form, as
            well as needing to be able to use their knowledge to make decisions
            in regards to the creation of an art piece of that style.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion B</strong> - Developing ideas. This criterion is
            all about planning for the creation of the product. The student will
            need to create detailed design specifications, create separate
            design ideas, choose and justify one, and develop accurate and
            detailed diagrams for their chosen final solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion C </strong> - Creating the solution. This
            criterion is where the student actually creates the product, putting
            together their new skills and knowledge from the previous two
            criteria to be able to create on cohesive product that fulfills the
            design brief. The students will need to be able to create a logical
            plan, follow the logical plan well enough to create the intended
            product, which functions as intended. Students also need to
            demonstrate excellent technical skills during this process. If
            changes were made to their design specifications, the student will
            need to be able to justify those changes. Finally, the student needs
            to present the final solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion D</strong> - Evaluating. This criterion is about
            being able to reflect on the process of creation up to this point.
            Students first need to design relevant testing methods to test their
            product, evaluate their final product with their design
            specifications and explain if and how the solution could be
            improved. Finally, the students need to be able to explain the
            impact of their product on their target audience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DP - The arts</h3>
        <p>In the DP, the arts are examined in the following ways.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Comparative Study</strong> - Students are asked to compare
            different pieces of art by different artists. This task explores
            different objects, artifacts and artworks from different time
            periods and cultural contexts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Process Portfolio</strong> - For this task, students are
            asked to submit a portfolio of selected artworks from their 2-year
            course which can evidently show how they experimented, learned, and
            used various different styles of art.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Exhibition</strong> - Finally, students are asked to
            submit a collection of completed artworks from their exhibition for
            assessment. The pieces should showcase their progress and
            understanding of the use of different methods to create ideas and
            convey those ideas through their chosen art form.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DP - Design</h3>
        <p>
          In the DP, design technology is assessed through four main criteria.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis of a design opportunity.</strong> - This criterion
            asks the student to analyse the different aspects of a design
            problem, such as the target audience, potential solutions, and how
            the problem affects the target audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conceptual design.</strong> - This criterion is all about
            planning and conceptualising a design for a solution to the problem
            assessed in the previous criterion. The student should be able to
            plan and get ready to execute a detailed plan to create a solution
            to the problem given.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Development of a detailed design.</strong> - This criterion
            is the execution of the plan to create the selected final design,
            the solution to the given problem. The student should be able to
            follow the plan and design brief created in the earlier criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing and evaluation.</strong> - This criterion is about
            testing the solution. The student should design effective testing
            methods to allow them to analyse the effectiveness of the solution
            in the context of the given problem. The student should be able to
            ensure that the product functions as intended, and fulfills the
            design brief to the satisfaction of the target audience.
