          What is the IB curriculum? This is a very important question that will
          be answered throughout this website. The IB curriculum is split into 4
          main parts. PYP, or the Primary Years Programme, MYP, or the Middle
          Years Programme, and the DP itself, which stands for the diploma
          programme. There is also a fourth, called CP (career program), with
          elements of the DP along with a career-related core. Unfortunately, I
          will not discuss the CP much. The first two, the MYP and the PYP are
          intended to give students an adaptive, hands-on learning experience,
          through the exploration of concepts called global contexts. These are
          wide-reaching topics that can help students learn a lot about
          themselves, the world around them, and how what they do impacts other
          people. I will go into more detail about these global contexts

          There are a few main projects that are vital to the curriculum. The
          main ones are the PYP exhibition, which is essentially a group project
          about a topic of the student’s choice, which can be anything from
          space exploration to animation. It aims to teach students about
          teamwork, research and presentation skills. These are all vital to the
          student’s further development and can help both in and out of the
          classroom. The student’s work is then graded, and weighs in on their
          report. Another important project is the personal project. This is an
          individual project that, similarly to the PYP exhibition, is unique to
          each student. For example, I personally chose to create this site in
          order to help new students to the IB curriculum, for my personal
          project. Other projects include remote-controlled airplanes, games,
          and many more. This project is based around three main sections, as
          shown on the
          <a class="text-link" href="https://www.ibo.org/"
            >official IB website</a
          >. It requires planning, and a concrete process that the student can
          replicate and that shows effort and the skill of the student, a
          tangible product, and an evaluation on the project as a whole. It is
          usually graded by the student’s own school, by supervisors, based on
          both external criteria, and ones that the students themselves set, as
          each project is unique, though the IB will moderate this, ensuring
          fair and unbiased grades.

          Finally, in years 12 and 13, the years where students prepare for
          passing the actual IB examination, beginning the IB diploma programme,
          or the IBDP, extended essays, TOK, and CAS are the main focuses
          outside of regular schoolwork. The extended essay is a 4,000-word
          essay on a research topic of the student's choice. It is completely
          independent, and no aid is given from the teachers other than to guide
          students through the overall process. The TOK exhibition is when a
          student chooses from 35 prompts given by the TOK organisation itself,
          and choose 3 objects. The student then needs to explain, through a
          written commentary, how that concept manifests in the real world. If
          you would like to learn about TOK, specifically, click
