        <p>
          Individuals and Societies subjects include both History and Geography.
          In the MYP, they are both assessed similarly, but they diverge in the
          DP.
        </p>
        <h3>MYP</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion A</strong> - Knowing and Understanding. This
            criterion is about students initially just showing their knowledge
            of individuals and societies, usually through correctly answering
            questions about them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion B</strong> - Investigating. This criterion
            requires students to showcase and develop their research skills,
            both collaboratively and singly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion C</strong> - Communicating. For this criterion,
            students need to be able to organize and display collected data in a
            variety of media and presentation types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion D</strong> - Thinking Critically. This criterion
            requires students to use their critical thinking skill in the
            context of different problems. This includes things like analysing
            sources and using information to make considered decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DP - Geography</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 1</strong> - This paper is 1.5 hours for SL and 2.25
            hours for HL. There is one structured question and one extended
            answer question. There is a choice between two different extended
            answer questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 2</strong> - Here, there are three structured
            questions, based off an infographic or some other visual stimulus,
            along with one extended answer question, again from a choice of two.
            This exam lasts for 1.25 hours for both HL and SL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 3 (HL)</strong> - This paper lasts for 1 hour. The
            student can choose between three extended, two-part questions to
            complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Internal Assessment</strong> - This makes up 20% of the
            student's grade. It consists of one written report that includes
            information collecting, analysis, and evaluation based on a
            fieldwork question from any appropriate syllabus topic.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DP - History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 1</strong> - Paper 1 is one hour long. It is based
            around four sources, upon which the student must answer 4 questions
            on. The first question judges the students' comprehension of the
            source, the second asks the student to evaluate one of the sources'
            values and limitation, the third asks the student to compare two of
            the sources, and the final question is an analytical essay question.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 2</strong> - Paper 1 is a 1 hour and 30 minute long
            paper. For this, students must choose two topics from a given list,
            and answer one essay question each.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 3 (HL)</strong> - Paper 3 is a 2 hour and 30 minute
            long paper. Students need to choose 3 essay questions out of a given
            36, and answer all three.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The IA</strong> - The Internal Assessment for History is an
            in-depth investigation of a historical event of interest to them.
            The students should clearly state a research question, undertake and
            clearly represent an investigation, and then effectively review
            their process, and what they learnt.
