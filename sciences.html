        <h3>MYP</h3>
        <p>
          In the MYP, all three sciences are assessed the same, so the following
          criteria apply to all the sciences. Initially, students are taught all
          three sciences as one subject. Later, they get to choose either 2 out
          of 3 of the sciences, or to continue doing all three in a condensed
          format, known as Integrated Sciences.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion A</strong> - Knowing and Understanding. For this
            criterion, students must be able to show and use their scientific
            knowledge to solve problems in both familiar and unfamiliar
            situations. Students must also be able to use their knowledge to
            make informed decisions, and scientifically supported judgements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion B</strong> - Inquiring and Designing. This
            criterion aims to make students capable of carrying out scientific
            investigations independently. Here, students should be able to
            propose a problem or come up with a question to be tested by a
            scientific investigation, come up with a testable hypothesis,
            explain it using scientific reasoning, and design scientific
            investigations. Student must also be able to explain the different
            variable and how they can be manipulated and measured.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion C</strong> - Processing and Evaluating. Students
            must be able to analyse the results of their investigations and
            others'. Students must be able to compile and effectively display
            collected data, and interpret and explain it as well. Students
            should also be able to evaluate the hypothesis, and see how valid it
            is, based on how the experiment turned out. Finally, students must
            be able to relect on their method, and suggest extensions or
            improvements to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion D</strong> - Reflecting on the impacts of science.
            This criterion is based off of students learning and displaying the
            ability to analyse and predict the impacts of science on various
            problems, and the factors that are affected by, or affect, the
            problem. Students should also be able to explain in what ways
            science can be used and applied to solve different problems.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DP</h3>
        <p>
          Even in the DP, for at least the subjects of Physics, Biology, and
          Chemistry, the methods of assessment are similar enough to be grouped
          together. The following methods of assessment are the same in
          structure for all three of the above sciences, but the content itself
          differs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 1</strong> - Paper 1 consists of 30 multiple choice
            questions for SL students, and 40 for HL students.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 2</strong> - Paper 2 consists of two sections, with
            several questions each. These questions usually supply the student
            with information in the form of graphs or tables, and then ask the
            student to answer various sub-questions throughout the course of the
            question, and then finally summarise the results. There is a second
            section, where there will be a choice of two questions for SL
            students, or a choice of three, for HL students. HL students must
            complete 2 out of the three options, while SL students only need to
            complete one.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 3</strong> - Paper 3 consists of data- and
            practical-based questions, along with some extended answer
            questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The IA</strong> - The IA, or the Internal Assessment is an
            assessment designed to test students' ability to research, act upon
            that research, and analyse their results and process. Essentially,
            students should perform an experiment, completely independently,
            using the full scientific method. Finally, students must complete a
            write up, on their investigation, which should be 6-12 pages long.
