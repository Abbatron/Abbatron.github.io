        <h3>MYP</h3>
        <p>
          English is an important subject within the IB MYP curriculum, and is
          mainly assessed through the following four criteria. Each of them
          consists of 20 marks within the e-Assessment.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion A</strong> - Knowledge, understanding, and
            interpretation. This criterion is based off of understanding various
            texts. It is usually assessed by the student needing to answer
            comprehension questions on a text, or write responses to questions
            about texts, which links neatly into both Criterion B and Criterion
            C. For example, a student could be asked to answer questions around
            the characters' motives, a sequence of events, or even about the
            author's intentions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion B</strong> - Organizing. This criterion is based
            off of the ability to organize one's writing well, and in accordance
            with the context given. For example, if a student was writing a
            comparative essay between two texts, it would be organized very
            differently than, for example, a poem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion C</strong> - Producing text. This criterion
            assesses the ability of the student to produce different texts. For
            example, the student could be asked to write a comparative essay
            between two texts, a story, a poem, and even an article. Usually,
            this is the main part of an english assessment. For example, in my
            own mocks, one of the tasks that had the most marks for criterion C
            was writing a fictional autobiographical text based on an image
            given.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion D</strong> - Using language. This criterion is
            assessed through the way the student uses language with knowledge of
            his or her audience. For example, if the student is told to write a
            piece of writing with 7 year olds in mind, but writes with language
            more suited to a 12th-grader, then the student would not score very
            well on that question. This criterion is why it is important to
            write appropriately for your target audience, and not just focus on
            the structure of the writing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Despite the potentially confusing nature of the assessment to those
          new to the MYP, it is a lot easier to understand than one might think.
          The MYP e-Assessment for English is 80 marks in total, 20 marks per
          criterion. Usually, it is important to understand both the composition
          and content of the text that the student needs to write, as both are
          very important in order to score as high as possible on the
          e-Assessment. In the marking of the English e-Assessment, the total
          number of marks are taken, out of 80, and ranges are given to give a
          grade from 1-7. Usually, the grades are given based on ranges decided
          by the teachers after careful consideration, based on the difficulty
          of the test, which is in turn usually based of the average scores of
          the students. For example, if everyone was to score above 50, scores
          below 50 could be graded as 5s, while if most people scored below 50,
          it could be graded as a 6, though this is unlikely.

        <h3>DP</h3>
        <p>
          English remains an important subject in the IB Diploma programme, but
          it become significantly more complex. Now, instead of working towards
          acing a singular e-Assessment at the end of two years, the student
          needs to prepare to pass a series of papers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 1</strong> - This paper focuses on understanding one
            text, in SL English, or two texts, in HL English, in 1 hour and 15
            minutes or 2 hours and 15 minutes respectively. These texts can be
            extracts from anything, fictional or non-fictional. Usually, the
            student is then asked an open-ended question at the end of the text,
            to be answered with a 'guided analysis'. It is important, when
            answering this question, to consider three things. What the
            immediate answer to the question is, how you know this, and what the
            author's intentions were. It is also important to consider the
            effect of the same on the audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 2</strong> - Paper 2 gives the student up to 4
            prompts. The student must choose one of these prompts, and using two
            texts that he or she has studied in class, must then write a
            1000-1500 word comparative essay, comparing and contrasting the two
            texts in the context of the given prompt. In SL English, 1 and a
            half hours are given, while in HL English, 2 hours are given, as HL
            students can compare 2 <em>or</em> 3 texts, while SL students only
            need to do two.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The IOs</strong> - The IOs, or individual orals, are perhaps
            the easiest to understand out of all the parts of english. These
            simply consist of the student choosing between two texts that have
            been studied in class, and speaking for 10 minutes on the chosen
            topic. Then, the student needs to answer questions on that text for
            5 minutes.
