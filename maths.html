        <h2>Maths through the IB</h2>
      </header>

      <article class="main-article">
        <p>
          Maths is one of my personal favourite subjects. It is also quite a
          complex subject, and the emphasis that the IB places on problem
          solving, and the way that the subject is structured, through the
          different criteria, could easily be confusing to students from other
          curriculums, so I am happy to be able to possibly help with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <p1>Disclaimer:</p1> In MYP, you are allowed to choose between higher
          level and lower level maths, but the only difference - in MYP at least
          - is more content in less time, so the following criteria apply to
          both.
        </p>

        <h3>MYP</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion A</strong> - Knowing and Understanding. Here, the
            students are assessed on how well they are able to select the
            correct way of solving problems, and how they can apply familiar
            concepts to try and solve unfamiliar ones. They should be able to
            apply the correct mathematics in order to get the correct answer.
            They should also be able to do so in many different contexts, both
            familiar and unfamiliar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion B</strong> - Investing Patterns. In this
            criterion, students should be able to recognize and correctly
            identify patterns, using mathematics if necessary to find complex
            patterns. Students need to be able to describe patterns as general
            rules that remain consistent with later findings.They also need to
            verify and justify that rule. Verifying that rule is as simple as
            double checking that rule with terms of that pattern that are not
            given, but that the student knows and is able to prove are correct.
            Justifying is slightly more complex, and evolves depending on what
            exactly the pattern and rule are. Justification is how the student
            can mathematically prove that their rule is correct, and their
            methods that they used to find the said rule are also correct.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion C</strong> - Communicating. This criterion is
            simple. It just requires the student to show adequate working-out,
            to ensure that logical, correct methods were used, in order to
            support criterion A. It is also important because, if a student
            makes a mistake in the answer, but their calculations were correct,
            showing those calculations can sometimes get half a mark if the
            student was going to get none. It is important that the calculations
            are coherent, cohesive, and concise. Mathematical notation should be
            used correctly and accurately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion D</strong> - Applying mathematics in real world
            contexts. For this criterion, students need to be able to identify
            relevant parts of a problem presented to them, select appropriate
            mathematical strategies to approach solving the problem, apply said
            strategies, and be able to justify both the degree of accuracy to
            which they believe the problem is solved and the degree of accuracy
            to which they believe the solution actually makes sense in the
            context of the real-world problem.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are actually two different types of maths available in the DP,
          Analysis and Approaches, or AA, and Applications and Interpretation,
          or AI. Both of these have a higher level (HL), and a standard level
          (SL). Simply put, HL maths is more complex and in depth than SL. SL
          maths usually teaches students what the concepts are, but HL maths
          goes much deeper, discussing how and why those concepts work, usually
          asking students to apply their learning to significantly more
          difficult problems.
        </p>
        <h3>DP - AI</h3>
        <p>
          AI maths is about the practical, real-world applications of certain
          parts of maths. This choice focuses more on things like statistics and
          distribution. This is usually a better choice for professions that
          require more the application of math rather than the theory behind it,
          like economics and management.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 1</strong> - Paper 1 is a 2-hour long short response
            paper, with questions being worth between 5 and 9 marks each. A
            calculator is allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 2</strong> - Paper 2 is a 2-hour long extended answer
            exam. It requires the students to show deeper understanding of the
            topics. Questions are usually worth 14 to 18 marks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 3 (HL only) </strong> - Paper 3 consists of two long
            questions. The exam lasts for one hour. The questions explore two HL
            concepts in detail.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The IA</strong> - All students are required to submit an IA,
            or internal assessment, that consists of a research paper done on a
            topic that interests the student, allowing students to apply their
            learning to real world concepts that interest them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DP - AA</h3>
        <p>
          AA maths is more focused on the theory behind maths, and is better for
          students that wish to go into professions such as engineering, data
          science, and machine learning.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 1</strong> - Paper 1 is a
            <em>non calculator</em> paper that lasts for 2 hours. It focuses on
            inquiry, reasoning, and algebraic manipulation. It consists of a
            short answer section and an extended answer section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 2</strong> - Paper 2 is a 2 hour long exam, and
            calculators are allowed. Paper 2, unlike paper 1, has a focus on
            using technology to find answers to mathematical problems, and tests
            how the student interprets and uses their findings. It consists of a
            short answer section and an extended answer section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 3 (HL only)</strong> - Paper 3, similarly to Paper 3
            in AIHL, is a 1 hour long exam that consists of 2 questions. The
            questions both place an emphasis on reasoning and inquiry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The IA</strong> - The IA is the same concept as the AI IA,
            and is an opportunity for students to apply their learning to a
            topic that interests them and to learn more about it.
