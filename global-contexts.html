          Global Contexts are important parts of the MYP curriculum. They are
          essentially different ideas that can be linked to different parts of
          learning, and are what the MYP units are based around. They are only
          used in MYP, as in PYP, a different system is used, called
          trans-disciplinary themes, that help set up the global contexts.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Identities and Relationships</strong> - This global context
            is based all around the idea of how people can affect other people
            things through their actions, and how they in turn can be affected
            by other people and things. It also explores the relationships
            between friends, families, and communities. Its PYP equivalent, or
            the trans-disciplinary theme associated with it, is
            <em>Who am I? Who are we?</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal and Cultural Expression</strong> - This global
            context is based around helping students learn the ways in which
            they can express themselves, their culture, and their emotions. It
            also encourages students to expand their creativity and reflect on
            their past experiences. Its PYP equivalent, or the
            trans-disciplinary theme associated with it, is
            <em>How we express ourselves</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fairness and Development</strong> - This global context
            discusses the different situations people and places are in. The
            students will explore their responsibilities to their community, and
            how to resolve problems peacefully. The PYP equivalent to this
            global context, or the trans-disciplinary theme equivalent to it, is
            <em>Sharing the planet</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scientific and Technical Innovation</strong> - This global
            context is all about the ways humans interact with their environment
            and each other, and the exploration of the ways that science is used
            in different situations. This global context also explores the
            impacts, both positive and negative, of scientific advances and
            their potential applications. The trans-disciplinary theme
            associated with it is <em>How the world works</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Globalisation and Sustainability</strong> - This global
            context is about helping students become more internationally-minded
            and learning about the different ways humans stay connected, both
            locally and internationally. It also encourages students to explore
            the different impacts of the global interconnectedness of modern
            society. The trans-disciplinary theme associated with it is
            <em>How we organize ourselves</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Orientation in Space and Time</strong> - This global context
            encourages students to look into how different points of history
            influence the modern day, and how things like location affect people
            in different ways. The PYP equivalent to this global context, or the
            trans-disciplinary theme equivalent to it, is
            <em>Where we are in space and time</em>.
