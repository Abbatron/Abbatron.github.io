          I am currently an IB student, studying at Emirates International
          School Jumeirah. I am making this website to try and help others
          understand the IB curriculum in all its facets. In this website, I
          will discuss the main subjects within the IB curriculum that are there
          in the PYP, MYP, and IB programmes. This includes English, but not,
          for example, computer science. I am creating this qebsite for my
          personal project, as I feel that it is very important that newcomers
          to the IB should be able to learn about how it is structured, and
          should be able to understand the differences between the IB curriculum
          and other curriculums, as it is very different from other curriculums,
          especially in the way the exams are laid out, and how they're graded.
          I decided that I wanted to do this because I have seen many new
          students to my school struggle in their studies simply because they
          are not used to the way that the IB works. For example, students
          coming from ICSE curriculum are focused on memorizing facts, and so
          the way that IB focuses on skills and the application thereof can
          often be challenging. So, I wanted to create a website that could help
          out people, especially those coming from other curriculums, to
          understand the IB, and how it works, as explained by someone who has
          experienced most of it. For the record, this website is not officially
          endorsed by the IB, and is entirely independent. Most information
          comes from either other IB students, IB teachers, and the
          <a class="text-link" href="https://www.ibo.org/" target="_blank"
            >official IB website</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through making this website, I hope that I can help some people who
          would otherwise be confused or unable to understand how parts of the
          IB work, and, in doing so, improve my own programming skills.
