        <p>
          Languages are a very large part of the MYP and DP parts of the IB
          curriculum. Personally, in my school, we needed to do 3 main
          languages, Arabic, English, and French in PYP, and in MYP we had a
          choice between French, Spanish, and Arabic, alongside English and
          Arabic according to the Ministry of Education curriculum, which is
          specific in the UAE. Normally, an IB student only needs to do either
          French, Spanish, or whatever other language is offered, along with
          English. Unfortunately, I don't know which language everyone will
          choose, but thankfully, for the chosen language, the criteria and the
          ways of testing in MYP and IB are structured the same, just with
          different content.
        </p>
        <h3>MYP</h3>
        <p>
          In the MYP, Language Acquisition subjects are assessed through
          formative and summative assessments. The formative assessments are use
          by teachers to get an idea of the students' progress and level of
          skill, while the summative assessments are used to actually take the
          grade of the student, from 1-8, and these are the ones that go on the
          report.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion A</strong> - Comprehending Spoken and Visual Text.
            Thankfully, the Language Acquisition criteria are fairly easy to
            understand. Criterion A is all about understanding the spoken
            language. The tests for this criterion usually include a recording
            or video, which the student has to listen to, understand, and then
            answer questions on. Usually, the recording is usually of something
            like an interview or someone talking about their experiences, for
            example on holiday, about their opinion on something, etc. There are
            questions first directly about the text, for example, "What did
            Emily do for her holiday?", where the student simply has to give a
            short, one to two line answer. There are then grammar questions, and
            finally, there are long answer questions, requiring the student to
            write out a paragraph answering them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion B</strong> - Comprehending Written and Visual
            Text. This criterion is nearly identical to Criterion A, but it
            focuses on understanding a written text rather than a spoken one.
            The texts can be anything from a letter or a news article. Similarly
            to Criterion A, the student needs to answer questions directly
            referring to the text, questions on grammar, and then finally a long
            answer question at the end of the section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion C</strong> - Communicating in response to spoken
            and/or written and/or visual text. This criterion is all about how
            the student is able to verbally communicate in response to different
            stimuli. For example, the student could be asked to describe an
            image, and then discuss its link to the country of origin of the
            language the student is speaking, for example, how the weather in
            the photo is similar to the weather in France, for example. The
            student needs to then be able to hold a conversation with the
            examiner for up to 6 minutes, depending on the level of the student.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Criterion D</strong> - Using language in spoken and/or
            written form. While this criterion does technically include both
            spoken and written form, the vast majority of the time this
            criterion consistes of being able to write a text in response to a
            prompt. It is important, when writing this text, to consider the
            target audience, which is usually given, the language you use, and,
            of course, your grammar. The organization and structure of your text
            is also important. For example, if writing a news article, the
            title, date, and subheadings are important.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DP</h3>
        <p>
          Language Acquisition in DP is based around a series of papers, along
          with an oral assessment, similarly to how English works.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 1</strong> - Productive Skills. Paper 1 requires the
            student to choose a writing task from 3 given options, each from a
            different theme, and to use the text type given in the instructions.
            Students are given 1 hour and 15 minutes for this task, to write
            250-400 words.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paper 2</strong> - Receptive Skills. This paper judges the
            ability of the student to understand the language, both spoken and
            written. The paper is 1 hour and 45 minutes. 45 minutes for
            listening comprehension and 1 hour for the reading comprehension.
            There are three recordings and three written texts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Individual Orals</strong> - A conversation between the
            teacher and the student in the chosen language, based on a visual
            stimulus, usually an image. The student needs to talk for at least
            15 minutes on the image. After this, the student and the teacher
            have a discussion on an additional, different theme. The student
            needs to talk for 5 minutes on the second topic, giving a total time
            of at least 20 minutes.
